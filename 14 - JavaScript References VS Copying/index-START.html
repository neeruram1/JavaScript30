    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const playersCopy = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    playersCopy[0] = 'Neeru';
    console.log(players, playersCopy);

    //it also changes the original array.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const teamCopy = team.map((x) => x);
    console.log(team, teamCopy)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    console.log(team.concat([]))

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const cloneTeamES6 = [...team];
    console.log(cloneTeamES6)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    let person1 = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(person1)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    let newPerson = {
      ...person
    };
    console.log(newPerson)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
